Enterian Concord,woe_enterian_concord,0,,,defensive,,0,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,johnshmo.woe.hullmods.EnterianConcord,"This ship has been modified with the esoteric manufacturing techniques of the Enterian Concord task group. Its specifications are nominally deviated from standard examples of this hull.

Vessels with this modification gain a %s/%s/%s/%s increase to armor strength, depending on hull size. Flux capacity and throughput are improved by %s, and weapons with ammunition see a %s increase to their maximum charges. Thanks to these radical changes, however, the ship's 0-flux speed bonus is reduced by %s.
